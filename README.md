OpenROV Cockpit
================

"[OpenROV](http://openrov.com/) is a DIY telerobotics community centered around underwater exploration & adventure."  One goal of OpenROV is to have onboard video for live viewing as the user operates the ROV.  Enter: OpenROV Cockpit.

The Cockpit project provides the UI and system integration to the hardware of the ROV.  It is a node.js application that is intended to run on the ROV directly that serves a HTML5 Single Page Application to a browser which uses either keyboard, gamepad, or touch to send commands back to the ROV.  

Cockpit provides a socket.io based API for low latency communication with the ROV.
